# Library-of-Congress-Search-Tool


In this project, I am building an application that searches and displays results from the Library of Congress API.

## Description

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a user, I can submit a search query from the application to request data and receive a response from the Library of Congress.

* As a user, I can either perform a generic search for data in all formats or I can select a format in the form to help filter results.

* As a user, I can see all of the results of my search displayed on a separate page.

* As a user, I can conduct additional searches from the results page as well.
